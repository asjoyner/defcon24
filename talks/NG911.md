# NG91-1-1: The Next Generation of Emergency Ph0nage

[Abstract](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#CINCVolFLT)

## Summary

The call has to go through, even if the authentication fails.  This means traditional security approaches don't work, and (IMHO) they have to change modes to accepting that, and focus on detecting and fighting spam/dos/abuse.  Fortunately, that's relatively straightforward given the regularity of 911 traffic patterns.  Unfortunately, the traditional public safety sector implementing this is ill-equipped to do that job, today.

## Notes
Vulnerabilities in the NC911 trust model.

E9-1-1 is part of the telephone world, not the IT world.  Trust provided by obscure signaling, physical security of the trunks, control plan segmentation, etc.  Also legal protection provided by harsh laws, etc.

In ~1967 they put out The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, envisoining universal 911 and a radio on every cop.  Very forward looking.

*Fundamental goal of 911: Who called, where, and with what?*

Was easy in the day of phones in house, bag phones, then VoIP really threw wrenches into that ability.
"In the begining, AT&T created the PSTN, and the security model was void and without form."

MSAG, Master Street Address Guide, feeds to ALI Automatic Location Identification.

At 911 dial time, some Class V switch uses ALi to derefef your number into an address from ALI.

Spoofing ANI is possible, automatically spoofs ALI.

### Forcing Functions
* Carriers are abandoning legacy TDM service in favor of IP-based local-loop products.
* Consumers have evolving expecdtations for 911:
   * message-based Text (SMS, iMessage, WhatsApp)
   * Real-Time Text
   * Two-Way Video
   * Images & Files

### Advantages (Shiny New Toys!)
* Dynamic, location-based routing
* easier failover and transfers
* mobile, virtual, and specialized Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)

Protocol allows external actors (Facebook, WhatsApp) to route calls to NG911 service centers.

* ESRP: Emergency Service routing Proxy, basically a SIP proxy
* ECRF: Emergency Call Routing Function, determines the most appropriate call routing point.
* PRF: Policy Routing Function, handle complex policies to handle a particular type of call.

### The Trouble with Trust
* Calls /must/ reach 911, even if the authentication fails
* 911 must operate in a "fail-working" model (fail open?)

### The hard to solve problem
Fail working means you can leverage that inherent design to make it do bad things.
1. Exploit crypto vulnerability

   It uses self-signed certs, and when the auth fails, you're still trusted just as much as any other PSAP.

2. Establish command and control
3. Forge geo-location coordinates

   Can forge your own location to the eSPI, and also direct *all* calls to their PSAP by writing a script in the eSPI format which captures and redirects those calls.  Sounds like modification of the PRF?

4. Exploit the "fail-working" model
5. DoS the PSAPs
6. Register and cause overflow traffic to flow to the attacker

### Why?
* DOS a Goegraphic area
* Redirect selected traffic
* Redundancy can be silently reduced or removed

Christmas Day Bombing in NYC would have been better thwarted if the user could have sent a picture of the creepy-looking white van... but if the terrorist organization was also snooping the 911 network, they could have replaced the creepy-looking white van with a photo of a red Toyota, and possibly have avoided that failure.

### Mitigations
* Need intrusion detection, a way to mark un-authenticated traffic as suspicious, etc.
* Have to build the CA.  Funding forthcoming.
* Today it's still mostly TDM, but does actually protect against most of these vulnerabilities for just today.
* Regularity of 911 traffic volume means that large-scale DOS would be noticed relatively quickly.
