# VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning & MITM Attacks in Virtualized Environments

[Abstract](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Bull)

## Summary
VLANs on a switch (soft or otherwise, imho) aren't sufficient protection for multitenant environments.  Yes, the layer2 attacks on physical devices work on the virtualized switches as well.

## Notes
Supposedly an expansion of last year's talk, which focused largely on attacking VMware VSwitch and the like.  They got 30k of funding and bought some more hardware, and ran some more local virtual switches.  I tuned out.
