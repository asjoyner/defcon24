# Slouching Towards Utpoia

[Abstract](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Granick)

## What is the dream?
Her dream of internet freedom: Computers will help us be more indviidualistic, connect us, individual rights were something that could be built into the tech world around us.  Decentralization wasn't just a computing principal, but of the political system around us.

Formative works of this dream:
* [Hackers by Steven Levy](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Heroes-Computer-Revolution-Anniversary/dp/1449388396)
* [Hacker Manifesto](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html)
* [The Hacker Crackdown by Bruce Sterling](http://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html)
* [Declaration of Indepdence in Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

## How are we doing?
Less and less true every day.

Freedom of expression is frequetly being infrinjged as we ask the middlemen (Facebook, Twitter, Google) to take down or deprioritize some portion of online contents (jihadist beheading videos, frank castile, hate speech on twitter, right to be forgotten).  Starts with stuff people agree on (coyright law, terrorist content) then goes to more contentious points (hate speech, facts some people don't want remembered, political policies, etc).

Surveilence is getting worse, tremendous quantities of data are avialable to LEO w/o a warrant in the US.  Other countries are worse.  Lots of loopholes, lots of legal battles being fought to try to raise the bar for the law to protect of your data. 

## Things that can help
* Build decentralization
* Regulation to preserve rights
* Start creating the tech for the next cycle of the revolution

Fear drives the current state of the world.  Fear of pedofiles, hate speach, malware, spam, will embrace walled garden, cheer for pressure on social networks.

4 regulators of human behavior:
* Technology
* Markets
* Law
* Norms

Have to bring those levers to bear on the problem.
