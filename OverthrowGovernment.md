# How to overthrow a Government

[Abstract](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Rock)

## Summary
Super high level analysis of the logic behind how to use cyber warfare to fomet a coup or revolution.  Thin on details, but raises interesting questions about Kuwait in 2011...

## Notes
Thinks now is the time to give this talk, because when James Clapper ranks threats to national security, Cyber Espionage came second to ISIS.  Chris Rock doesn't want to live in a world where Cyber Espionage is second to ISIS.  :)

Occupier + Occuped Country = Terrorists, a consistent lesson through history.

Comparrison of ISIS methods with hacker methods, hilarity ensues.

Simon solicited advice from Simon Mann, Dogs of War Coup Architect.

Why Mercenaries?  It's not a war if you use mercenaries.
*Executive Outcomes* is an awesome name for a mercenary company.

1. Throw an election?

Lots of options, but Australlian example of the last minute SMS message to everyone in the country about medicare scare tactic.  Advises more like the "12 days of christmas", closer together, less drawn out.

2. Coup
   a. Tactical Operations / low intensity operations
   b. Coup or Revolution
   coup: iran
   revolution: ukraine
   c. Invade
      had 5 failed coups before invasion of panama

## Suppression techniques
political iniviatives

Spy vs. Spy, coup prevented by having spies that spy on the military

Fake coup: Arrest your opponents and accuse them of plotting a coup

## Operation Nanny Goat
2011, overthrow Kuwait

Objective: overthrow Prime Minister Nasser Al Sabbah

Private Intelligence Agencies provide intel, but better to hack our and their government to get the info directly.

Kuwait: People are not happy that the government is rich, and people are poor.  Won't work in every country, depends

Options:
1. Elections?  Nope, not elected.
2. Coup?  Nope, it's too hot.  Also lots of military presence, and 7k soldiers protecting Royal Family.
3. Revolution... Just right!

Map the targets to hack, enlist deputies to run each section and marshall

Professional agitation, pay people to start protests.

### Financing
GoFundMe?  Probably not.

Banks have lots of money, use their money..

Banks have lots of money, use their money.  Also, deposit moneies to the political targets to fomet the coup.

### Hacking
Hack all the things.  Banks, Government, Telcos, etc.

Enipedia shows locations of power plants.  Provides nice map of targets to cut off power and water, angers the populace and fomets the coup.

EIA provides the equivalent info on the US power infrastructure.

Can shoot, drill or angle-grind transformers to drain the oil from them... how about a Mr. Choppy drone?  Built a drone for doing it.  Or just drag an arc short across them.

PWN a few media outlets.  Media needs two sources, so provide them the two they're looking for.  Or just hack them directly and release it.  Aim for the right news outlet who's biased against the candidate you're attempting to smear (eg. Hillary news, send it to Fox, they'll eat it up).

Kuwaiti Prince convert to Christianity?  Got the coverage they wanted, but was a stupid idea.

Use the money in your pockets to heat up the population, professional agitators to stage a protest, then a separate set of agitators dressed as police to rough them up, and get that on the news.  If the news won't carry it, publish it yourself, remember you hacked the media.

### Video
He put together a very entertaining video putting together the pieces of how all this would have been possible against the Kuwait government, to the point where I'm not quite sure if this was actually a thing he or someone else was directly involved it.  :)

### Challenge
Think bigger.  Combine multiple targets.
