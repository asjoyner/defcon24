DESCRIPTION:With this presentation\, we take a new approach to reverse engi
 neering. Instead of attempting to decompile code\, we seek to undo the work
  of the linker and produce relocatable files\, the typical output of a comp
 iler. The main benefit of the later technique over the former being that it
  does work. Once achieved universal code ‘reuse’ by relinking those relocat
 able objects as arbitrary shared libraries\, we'll create a form of binary 
 reflection\, add scripting capabilities and in memory debugging using a JIT
  compiler\, to attain automated API prototyping and annotation\, which\, we
  will argue\, constitutes a primary form of binary code self awareness. Fin
 ally\, we'll see how abusing the dynamic linker internals shall elegantly s
 olve a number of complex tasks for us\, such as calling a given function wi
 thin a binary without having to craft a valid input to reach it. \n\nThe ap
 plications in terms of vulnerability exploitation\, functional testing\, st
 atic analysis validation and more generally computer wizardry being tremend
 ous\, we'll have fun demoing some new exploits in real life applications\, 
 and commit public program profanity\, such as turing PEs into ELFs\, functi
 onal scripting of sshd in memory\, stealing crypto routines without even di
 sassembling them\, among other things that were never supposed to work. All
  the above techniques have been implemented into the Wichcraft Compiler Col
 lection\, to be released as proper open source software (MIT/BSD-2 licenses
 ) exclusively at DEF CON 24.\n\nJonathan Brossard is a computer whisperer f

DESCRIPTION:At DEF CON 16 in 2008\, we released the original BSODomizer (ww
 w.bsodomizer.com)\, an open source VGA pranking tool and introductory hacki
 ng platform for the multicore Propeller micro-controller. Hours of producti
 vity were replaced with rage and frustration as unwitting computer users we
 re confronted with fake Blue Screens of Death and revolting ASCII art. But\
 , the world has changed. The machines have risen in capability. HDMI is the
  graphical transmission protocol of choice and hacking with micro-controlle
 rs is standard issue. The as-seen-on-HDTV duo of Joe Grand and Zoz return w
 ith the next generation of mischievous hardware\, a device that supplants o
 r captures any inline HDMI signal in a discreet\, pentest-worthy package. B
 SODomizer HD is an FPGA-based system that not only improves on the graphics
  interception and triggering features of its predecessor\, but can now capt
 ure screenshots of a target system and also provides a fully open design th
 at you can use for your own experiments into the mystical world of massive\
 , customizable arrays of digital logic. We'll guide you through the process
  of going from lamer zero to hacker hero with FPGAs\, while savagely fuckin
 g with a few unfortunate friends along the way!\n\nJoe Grand\, also known a

DESCRIPTION:Does the FBI have to tell Apple of the vuln it used to break th
 eir iPhone? How many 0days every year go into the NSA arsenal -- dozens\, h
 undreds or thousands? Are there any grown-ups in Washington DC watching ove
 r FBI or NSA as they decide what vulns to disclose to vendors and which to 
 keep to themselves? These are all key questions which have dominated so muc
 h of 2016\, yet there's been relatively little reliable information for us 
 to go on\, to learn what the Feds are up to and whether it passes any defin
 ition of reasonableness.\n\nBased on open-source research and interviews wi
 th many of the principal participants\, this talk starts with the pre-histo
 ry starting in the 1990s before examining the current process and players (
 as it turns out\, NSA prefers to discover their own vulns\, CIA prefers to 
 buy). The current process is run from the White House with "a bias to discl
 ose" driven by a decision by the President (in because of the Snowden revel
 ations). The entire process was made public when NSA was forced to deny med
 ia reports that it had prior knowledge of Heartbleed.\n\nJason Healy is a S
 enior Research Scholar at Columbia University's School for International an
 d Public Affairs. During his time in the White House\, he coordinated effor

 Specialist at Code White Gmbh\n\nThe CAN bus is really mainstream\, and eve
 ry now and then there are new tools coming out to deal with it. Everyone wa
 nts to control vehicles and already knows that you can make the horn honk b
 y replaying that frame you captured. But is this all that there is on this 
 topic? Reversing OEM and third party tools\, capturing firmware update file
 s on the fly\, and hijacking Security Sessions on a bus are just a few exam
 ples of things that can be done as well. For this and more\, we will introd
 uce to you the CanBadger! It's not just a logger\, neither an injector. It'
 s a reversing tool for vehicles that allows you to interact in realtime wit
 h individual components\, scan a bus using several protocols (yup\, UDS is 
 not the only one) and perform a series of tests that no other tool offers. 
 The CanBadger is where the real fun begins when dealing with a vehicle\, an
 d you can build it under $60USD! If you are already done with replaying fra
 mes on the CAN bus and want to learn how that fancy chip-tuning tool deals 
 with your car\, or simply want to get Security Access to your vehicle witho
 ut caring about the security key or algorithm\, we are waiting for you!\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Guevara Noubir Professor\, College of Computer and Information 
 Science\, Northeastern University\nAmirali Sanatinia PhD candidate\, Colleg
 e of Computer and Information Science\, Northeastern University\n\nTor is a
  widely used anonymity network that protects users' privacy and and identit
 y from corporations\, agencies and governments. However\, Tor remains a pra
 ctical system with a variety of limitations\, some of which were indeed exp
 loited in the recent past. In particular\, Tor's security relies on the fac
 t that a substantial number of its nodes do not misbehave. \n\nPrevious wor
 k showed the existence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example\,
  there are some Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and 
 carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another categor
 y of misbehaving Tor relays (HSDirs)\, that are integral to the functioning
  of the hidden services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS directo
 ry for the dark web. Because of their nature\, detecting their malicious in
 tent and behavior is much harder. We introduce\, the concept of honey onion
 s (honions)\, a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir capab
 ility. By setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for more t
 han 72 days\, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior among HSDir
 s. \n\nWe propose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HSDirs
  and identify them\, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Our exp
 erimental results indicate that during the period of our work at least 110 
 such nodes were snooping information about hidden services they host. We re
 veal that more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructure and de
 layed the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback. Further
 more\, we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping Tor HSDirs

DESCRIPTION:Frontrunning the Frontrunners\nDr. Paul VixieCEO and Co-founder
 \, Farsight Security\, Inc.\n\n-While some domainers allegedly brainstorm i
 deas for new domains to register while taking a shower\, the more successfu
 l domain portfolio managers\, working at scale\, are believed to be ‘data d
 riven.’ DNS queries are a material source of intelligence about domainer op
 portunities and operations\, and also help us to understand the operational
  constraints around potentially combating domainers\, should we want to do 
 so. In this presentation co-authored with Farsight Security Scientist Dr. J
 oe St Sauver\, Farsight Security CEO Dr. Paul Vixie will scrutinize failed 
 DNS queries (‘NXDOMAINs’)\, looking for the same ‘opportunities’ that a dom
 ainer or typo squatter would (although we will not be acting on that data b
 y actually registering domains). \n\nDr. Vixie will discuss two primary typ
 es of behavior: 1) Volumetrically-driven typo-squatting\, which Dr. Vixie w
 ill measure by computing the volume of NXDOMAINs seen by domain during a 24
  hour period\, and the time between popular typos appearing in NXDOMAINs an
 d those same domains being registered and actually used\, and 2) Domainers 
 programmatically exploring permutations of domains around high value domain
 s\, probing for available domains and automatically registering the most pr
 omising probed domains discovered to still be available. Both of these hypo
 thesized behaviors should be externally observable and thus able to be conf
 irmed by watching a real-time stream of NXDOMAIN errors\, and a real-time s
 tream of newly observed\, actually-registered domains\, as available from t
 he Security Information Exchange.\n\nDr. Paul Vixie will experimentally con
 firm these hypothesized relationships and describe examples of (1) the most
  commonly observed types of typographical errors\, (2) the brands apparentl
 y most-targeted for squatting\, (3) the distribution of delays from NXDOMAI
 N detection to observed domain use\, (4) the potential relationship between
  NXDOMAIN volume thresholds and TLD cost. Dr. Vixie will also explain how t
 his information illuminates opportunities for tackling these types of domai
 n name abuse. Time will be reserved for Q&A.\n\nDr. Paul Vixie is the CEO a
 nd Co-founder of Farsight Security. He previously served as President\, Cha
 irman and Founder of Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)\, as President of MA
 PS\, PAIX and MIBH\, as CTO of Abovenet/MFN\, and on the boards of several 
 for-profit and non-profit companies. He served on the ARIN Board of Trustee

DESCRIPTION:Tom Kopchak Director of Technical Operations\, Hurricane Labs\n
 \nSolid state drives drives are fundamentally changing the landscape of the
  digital forensics industry\, primarily due to the manner in which they res
 pond to the deletion of files. Previous research has demonstrated that SSDs
  do not always behave in an equivalent manner to magnetic hard drives\, how
 ever\, the scope of these differences and the conditions that lead to this 
 behavior are still not well understood. This basic\, undeniable anomaly reg
 arding file storage and recovery begs one simple\, yet critical question: c
 an the data being mined for evidence be trusted?\n\nThis talk presents rese
 arch on the forensic implications of SSDs from one of the most comprehensiv
 e studies to date. The goal of this study was to demonstrate and quantify d
 ifferences across a sample pool of drives in an array of tests conducted in
  a controlled environment. These tests explored the variations between driv
 e firmware\, controllers\, interfaces\, operating systems\, and TRIM state.
 \n\nFurther observations revealed that some drives behaved nearly identical
  to the control drive\, while others showed that the prospects of recoverin
 g deleted data was significantly reduced. This presentation will demonstrat
 e these differences and provide a framework to allow forensics investigator
 s to determine the likelihood of successful deleted file recovery from an e
 vidence bearing solid state drive.\n\nTom Kopchak is the Director of Techni
 cal Operations at Hurricane Labs\, where he pretends to manage a team of ne
 twork and system engineers\, but is still an engineer and technology geek a
 t heart. While new to the DEF CON stage\, Tom’s speaking experience include

DESCRIPTION:Radia Perlman EMC Fellow\n\nOften distributed systems are consi
 dered robust if one of the components halts. But a failure mode that is oft
 en neglected is when a component continues to operate\, but incorrectly. Th
 is can happen due to malicious intentional compromise\, or simple hardware 
 faults\, misconfiguration\, or bugs. Unfortunately\, there is no single add
 -on to designs that will fix this case. This talk presents three very diffe
 rent systems and how they each handle resilience despite malicious particip
 ants. The problems\, and the solutions\, are very different. The important 
 message of this talk is that there is no one solution\, and that this case 
 must be considered in designs.\n\nRadia Perlman is a Fellow at EMC. She has

  to generate simple menus on the monitor\, allowing the user to change sett
 ings like brightness\, contrast and input source. However\, OSDs are effect
 ively independent general-purpose computers that can: read the content of t
 he screen\, change arbitrary pixel values\, and execute arbitrary code supp
 lied through numerous control channels. We demonstrate multiple methods of 
 loading and executing arbitrary code in a modern monitor and discuss the se
 curity implication of this novel attack vector. \n\nWe also present a thoro
 ugh analysis of an OSD system used in common Dell monitors and discuss atta
 ck scenarios ranging from active screen content manipulation and screen con
 tent snooping to active data exfiltration using Funtenna-like techniques. W
 e demonstrate a multi-stage monitor implant capable of loading arbitrary co
 de and data encoded in specially crafted images and documents through activ
 e monitor snooping. This code infiltration technique can be implemented thr
 ough a single pixel\, or through subtle variations of a large number of pix
 els. We discuss a step-by-step walk-through of our hardware and software re
 verse-analysis process of the Dell monitor. We present three demonstrations
  of monitoring exploitation to show active screen snooping\, active screen 
 content manipulation and covert data exfiltration using Funtenna. \n\nLastl
 y\, we discuss realistic attack delivery mechanisms\, show a prototype impl
 ementation of our attack using the USB Armory and outline potential attack 
 mitigation options. We will release sample code related to this attack prio
 r to the presentation date.\n\nDr. Ang Cui is the Founder and Chief Scienti

DESCRIPTION:Jennifer S. Granick Director of Civil Liberties\, Stanford Cent
 er for Internet and Society\n\nIs the Internet going to live up to its prom
 ise as the greatest force for individual freedom that the world has ever kn
 own? Or is the hope for a global community of creative intellectual interac
 tion lost…for now?\n\nIn last year’s Black Hat keynote—entitled "Lifecycle 
 of a Revolution"—noted privacy and civil liberties advocate Jennifer Granic
 k told the story of the Internet utopians\, people who believed that Intern
 et technology could greatly enhance creative and intellectual freedom. Gran
 ick argued that this Dream of Internet Freedom was dying\, choked off by ma
 rket and government forces of centralization\, regulation\, and globalizati
 on. The speech was extremely popular. Almost 8000 people watched it at Blac
 k Hat. It was retweeted\, watched and read by tens of thousands of people. 
 Boing Boing called it "the speech that won Black Hat (and DEF CON )."\n\nTh
 is year\, Granick revisits the state of the Internet Dream. This year’s cry
 pto war developments in the U.S. and U.K. show governments’ efforts to cont
 rol the design of technologies to ensure surveillance. The developments als
 o show that governments see app stores as a choke point for regulation and 
 control\, something that couldn’t easily happen with general purpose comput
 ers and laptops but which could be quite effective in a world where most pe
 ople access the network with mobile devices.\n\nAlso in the past year\, the
  European Court of Justice embraced blocking orders and ISP liability in th
 e name of stopping copyright infringement\, privacy violations\, and unflat
 tering comments from ever being published online. The effect of these devel
 opments is to force Internet companies to be global censors on the side of 
 online civility against the free flow of information and opinion. If we wan
 t to realize some of the promise of the Internet utopian vision\, we are go
 ing to have to make some hard political choices and redesign communications
  technology accordingly. The future could look a lot like TV\, or we could 
 work to ensure our technology enshrines individual liberties. This talk wil
 l help attendees join that effort.\n\nIn 1995\, Jennifer Granick attended h
 er first DEF CON at the Tropicana Hotel. Since then\, she has defended hack
 ers and coders in computer crime\, copyright\, DMCA and other cases. Jennif
 er left her criminal law practice in 2001 to help start the Stanford Center

  Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw\, Computer Crime Law\, Internet interm
 ediary liability\, and Internet law and policy. From 2008 to 2010\, Jennife

 n\nThe main topic of this technical talk will be "sandboxes" and how to esc
 ape them. One of the main component of the modern operating systems securit
 y is their sandbox implementation. Android for example in recent versions a
 dded SELinux to their existing sandbox mechanism\, to add an additional lay
 er of security. As well OS X recently added System Integrity Protection as 
 a ‘system level’ sandbox\, in addition to the regular sandbox which is ‘per
 -process’.\n\nAll modern OS focus on defense in depth\, so an attacker and 
 a defender must know these mechanisms\, to bypass them or make them more se
 cure. We will focus on Android and iOS/OSX to show the audience the impleme
 ntations of the sandbox in these operating systems\, the attack surface fro
 m within interesting sandboxes\, like the browser\, or applications sandbox
 .\n\nThen we will discuss how to attack them and escape from our restricted
  context to compromise further the system\, showcasing vulnerabilities. We 
 think that comparing Android with iOS/OSX can be very interesting since the
 ir implementation is different\, but the goal for attackers and defenders i
 s the same\, so having knowledge of different sandboxes is very insightful 
 to highlight the limitations of a particular implementation. The sandboxes 
 some years ago were related mainly to our desktop\, mobile phone or tablet.
  But if we look now at the technology trend\, with Automotive and IOT\, we 
 can understand that sandboxes will be crucial in all those technologies\, s
 ince they will run on mainstream operating system when they will become mor
 e popular.\n\nMarco Grassi is currently a Senior Security Researcher of the
  KEEN Lab of Tencent (previously known as KEEN Team). He was one of the mai

DESCRIPTION:Anthony Rose Hacker\nBen Ramsey\, Hacker\n\nMany Bluetooth Low 
 Energy (BLE) enabled deadbolts and padlocks have hit the market recently. T
 hese devices promise convenience and security through smartphone control. W
 e investigated sixteen of these products from multiple vendors and discover
 ed wireless vulnerabilities in most of them. Using a $50 antenna\, we succe
 ssfully picked vulnerable locks from over 400 meters away. In this presenta
 tion we introduce open source tools to crack each of the vulnerable BLE loc
 ks. Furthermore\, after surveying the open source Bluetooth hacking tools c
 urrently available\, we find very little support for BLE. So\, to make disc
 overing and range finding to BLE devices easier\, we introduce a new open s
 ource war-walking tool compatible with both Bluetooth Classic and BLE.\n\nA
 nthony Rose is an electrical engineer with five years of network security e
 xperience. His prior work includes traffic and quality optimization for wir
 eless video protocols. Currently he focuses on Bluetooth security and wirel
 ess penetration testing.\n\nBen Ramsey\, PhD\, CISSP\, has over a decade of
  experience in network security research. His work focuses on critical infr
 astructure protection and low power wireless protocols\, such as ZigBee\, Z
 -Wave\, and Bluetooth Low Energy. He has published in several academic jour

DESCRIPTION:Rogan Dawes Researcher\, Sensepost\nDominic White CTO\, SensePo
 st\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll cover some novel USB-level attacks\, that can pr
 ovide remote command and control of\, even air-gapped machines\, with a min
 imal forensic footprint\, and release an open-source toolset using freely a
 vailable hardware.\n\nIn 2000\, Microsoft published its 10 Immutable laws o
 f security [1]. One of which was "if a bad guy has unrestricted access to y
 our computer\, it's not your computer anymore." This has been robustly demo
 nstrated over the years. Examples include numerous DMA-access attacks again
 st interfaces such as firewire [2]\, PCMCIA and thunderbolt [3] as well as 
 USB-based attacks including simple in-line keyloggers\, "evil maid" attacks
  [4] and malicious firmware [5].\n\nDespite these warnings\, groups such as
  the NSA were still able to use physical access to bypass software controls
  with toolsets such as COTTONMOUTH [6]. Likewise\, criminals have been able
  to defraud banks with a handful of simple hardware tricks [7]. While some 
 progress has been made to secure some devices against some threats\, such a
 s the use of full disc encryption\, or the impact of Apple's secure enclave
  in the physical security of the iPhone [8]\, most laptops and desktops rem
 ain vulnerable to attacks via physical interfaces.\n\nIn our experience\, o
 rganisations merely view USB devices as a channel for malware or unsanction
 ed communications\, and rely on protections placed elsewhere in their defen
 sive stack to deal with them\, but few deal with the risk the USB interface
  presents directly. There are many scenarios where gaining physical access 
 to hosts is plausible [9]\, and having done so can provide access to "chewy
 " internal networks [10] ripe for lateral movement.\n\nWhile most people ar
 e familiar with USB devices\, many don't realise the extent to which the US
 B standard allows seemingly innocuous devices to have multiple personalitie
 s. There has been an extensive amount of research into malicious USB device
 s\, such as TURNIPSCHOOL [15]\, GoodFET/Facedancer [16]\, Shikra [17]\, Rub
 ber Ducky [11]\, USBdriveby [12] and BadUSB [5]. However\, none of these im
 plement an end-to-end attack either because that was not their intention\, 
 they only focus on a part of the attack or the project was never completed.
 \n\nAdditionally\, existing attacks are predominantly "send only" with no b
 uilt-in bidirectional communications. They usually rely on the executed pay
 load and the host’s networks for any advanced remote access. Thus\, these p
 ayloads can leave a significant forensic footprint in the form of network c
 ommunications and on-host behaviours\, and leave them vulnerable to anti-ma
 lware controls. Numerous companies are improving toolsets to detect such at
 tacks [13][14]. Lastly\, these attacks are often "spray and pray"\, unable 
 to account for variations in the user's behaviour or computer setup.\n\nOur
  approach is to create a stealthy bi-directional channel between the host a
 nd device\, with remote connectivity via 3G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and offload the
  complexity to our hardware\, leaving a small simple stub to run on the hos
 t. This talk will discuss the process of creating a set of malicious USB de
 vices using low cost hardware. The design and toolkit will be released duri
 ng the talk.\n\nOur toolkit provides three significant improvements over ex
 isting work. The first is the ability to gain a stealthy bi-directional cha
 nnel with the host via the device. No traffic is generated on the target ne
 twork (i.e it would work against air-gapped hosts). This is done via the us
 e of either a raw HID device or standard USB class printer driver linked to
  our device\, with the stub merely wrapping commands and their output to ou
 r device. The second is the ability to communicate with the device remotely
  via Wi-Fi/3G/Bluetooth\, allowing for updates to the payloads\, exfiltrati
 on of data\, real-time interaction with the host and an ability to debug pr
 oblems. This also has the advantage that any network controls are bypassed.
  Finally\, the stub running on the host will leave a minimal forensic trail
 \, making detection of the attack\, or analysis of it later\, difficult. Fo
 r completeness sake\, a new transport for metasploit was developed to allow
  metasploit payloads to be used instead.\n\nOur hope is that the tools will
  provide a method of demonstrating the risk of physical bypasses of softwar
 e security without an NSA budget\, and encourage defences to be built in th
 is area.\n\n[1] "10 Immutable Laws of Security" https://technet.microsoft.c

DESCRIPTION:Fred Bret-Mounet Hacker\n\nI got myself a new toy: A solar arra
 y... With it\, a little device by a top tier manufacturer that manages its 
 performance and reports SLAs to the cloud. After spending a little time des
 cribing why it tickled me pink\, I'll walk you through my research and yes\
 , root is involved! Armed with the results of this pen test\, we will cover
  the vendor's reaction to the bee sting: ostrich strategy\, denial\, panic\
 , shooting the messenger and more. Finally\, not because I know you get it\
 , but because the rest of the world doesn't\, we'll cover the actual threat
 s associated with something bound to become part of our critical infrastruc
 ture. Yes\, in this Shodan world\, one could turn off a 1.3MW solar array b
 ut is that as valuable as using that device to infiltrate a celebrity's hom
 e network?\n\nFred Bret-Mounet's descent into the underworld of security be
 gan as a pen tester at @stake. Now\, he leads a dual life--info sec leader 
 by day\, rogue hacker by night. His life in the shadows and endless curiosi
 ty has led to surprising home automation hacks\, playing with Particle Phot
 ons and trying to emulate Charlie & Chris' car hacking on his I3.\n\nTwitte

DESCRIPTION:Przemek Jaroszewski CERT Polska/NASK\n\nWhile traveling through
  airports\, we usually don't give a second thought about why our boarding p
 asses are scanned at various places. After all\, it's all for the sake of p
 assengers' security. Or is it? The fact that boarding pass security is brok
 en has been proven many times by researchers who easily crafted their passe
 s\, effectively bypassing not just ‘passenger only’ screening\, but also no
 -fly lists. Since then\, not only security problems have not been solved\, 
 but boarding passes have become almost entirely bar-coded. And they are inc
 reasingly often checked by machines rather than humans. Effectively\, we're
  dealing with simple unencrypted strings of characters containing all the i
 nformation needed to decide on our eligibility for fast lane access\, duty-
 free shopping\, and more... \n\nWith a set of easily available tools\, boar
 ding pass hacking is easier than ever\, and the checks are mostly a securit
 y theater. In my talk\, I will discuss in depth how the boarding pass infor
 mation is created\, encoded and validated. I will demonstrate how easy it i
 s to craft own boarding pass that works perfectly at most checkpoints (and 
 explain why it doesn't work at other ones). \n\nI will also discuss IATA re
 commendations\, security measures implemented in boarding passes (such as d
 igital signatures) and their (in)effectiveness\, as well as responses I got
  from different institutions involved in handling boarding passes. There wi
 ll be some fun\, as well as some serious questions that I don't necessarily
  have good answers to.\n\nPrzemek Jaroszewski is a member of CERT Polska (p

 n\nWe've all worked on ‘closed systems’ with little to no direct Internet a
 ccess. And we've all struggled with the limitations those systems put on us
  in the form of available tools or software we want to use. I didn't like s
 truggling\, so I came up with a method to load whatever I wanted on to a cl
 osed system without triggering any common security alerts. To do this I had
  to avoid accessing the Internet or using mag media. In the end all I neede
 d was an office multi-function machine and Excel. It's all any insider need
 s. \n\nFor my presentation and demo\, I'll show you how I delivered a selec
 t group of PowerSploit tools to a clean\, isolated machine. Of course\, Exc
 el has been known as vector for macro viruses for quite some time and some 
 of the techniques--such as hex-encoding binary data and re-encoding it on a
  target machine--are known binary insertion vectors but I have not found an
 y prior work on an insider using these techniques to deliver payloads to cl
 osed systems. You'll leave my presentation knowing why Excel\, umm\, excels
  as an insider attack tool\, how to leverage Excel features to load and ext
 ract arbitrary binary data from a closed network\, and what to do if this r
 eally frightens you.\n\nMike has over 20 years experience in the military. 
 He has been part of everything from systems acquisition\, to tactical intel
 ligence collection\, to staff work\, to leading a unit dedicated to data lo
 ss prevention. He recently retired from active military service and is now 
 working as a systems security engineer. This is Mike's first security confe
 rence presentation and will also be the first public release of a tool he h
 as written. Mike has previously published twice in 2600 magazine. Mike is s
 uper proud of his OSCP certification. He's also a CISSP.\n\nTwitter: @miket

 \, Zhejiang University\nWenyuan Xu Professor\, Electrical Engineering\, Zhe
 jiang University\nTo improve road safety and driving experiences\, autonomo
 us vehicles have emerged recently\, and they can sense their surroundings a
 nd navigate without human inputs. Although promising and proving safety fea
 tures\, the trustworthiness of these cars has to be examined before they ca
 n be widely adopted on the road. Unlike traditional network security\, auto
 nomous vehicles rely heavily on their sensory ability of their surroundings
  to make driving decision\, which opens a new security risk. Thus\, in this
  talk we examine the security of the sensors of autonomous vehicles\, and i
 nvestigate the trustworthiness of the 'eyes' of the cars. In this talk\, we
  investigate sensors whose measurements are used to guide driving\, i.e.\, 
 millimeter-wave radars\, ultrasonic sensors\, forward-looking cameras. In p
 articular\, we present contactless attacks on these sensors and show our re
 sults collected both in the lab and outdoors on a Tesla Model S automobile.
  We show that using off-the-shelf hardware\, we are able to perform jamming
  and spoofing attacks\, which caused the Tesla's blindness and malfunction\
 , all of which could potentially lead to crashes and greatly impair the saf
 ety of self-driving cars. To alleviate the issues\, at the end of the talk 
 we propose software and hardware countermeasures that will improve sensor r
 esilience against these attacks.\n\nJianhao Liu is the director of ADLAB at
  Qihoo 360. He specializes in the security of Internet of Things and Intern
 et of Vehicles. He has reported a security vulnerability of Tesla Model S\,

DESCRIPTION:\nJmaxxz Hacker\n\nAs our homes become smarter and more connect
 ed we come up with new ways of reasoning about our privacy and security. Ve
 ndors promise security\, but provide little technical information to back u
 p their claims. Further complicating the matter\, many of these devices are
  closed systems which can be difficult to assess. This talk will explore th
 e validity of claims made by one smart lock manufacturer about the security
  of their product. The entire solution will be deconstructed and examined a
 ll the way from web services to the lock itself. By exploiting multiple vul
 nerabilities Jmaxxz will demonstrate not only how to backdoor a front door\
 , but also how to utilize these same techniques to protect your privacy.\n\
 nJmaxxz works as a software engineer for a Fortune 100 company\, and is a s
 ecurity researcher for pleasure. His FlashHacker program was featured in Li
 fehacker's most popular free downloads of 2010. More recently he has contri
 buted to the node_pcap project which allows interfacing with libpcap from n
 ode. His other interests include lock picking and taking things apart.\n

 roviders offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a 
 multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to
  the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could b
 e as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicate
 d as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLA
 Ns\, QoS\, and monitoring. At DEF CON 23\, we presented how attacks known t
 o be successful on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterpart
 s. Here\, we present new results demonstrating successful attacks on more c
 omplicated virtual switch configurations such as VLANs. In particular\, we 
 demonstrate VLAN hopping\, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks acro
 ss every major hypervisor platform. We have added more hypervisor environme
 nts and virtual switch configurations since our last disclosure\, and have 
 included results of attacks originating from the physical network as well a
 s attacks originating in the virtual network.\n\nMr.Bull is an Assistant Pr

DESCRIPTION:\nAdam Donenfeld Senior Security Researcher\, Check Point\n\nFo
 llowing recent security issues discovered in Android\, Google made a number
  of changes to tighten security across its fragmented landscape. However\, 
 Google is not alone in the struggle to keep Android safe. Qualcomm\, a supp
 lier of 80% of the chipsets in the Android ecosystem\, has almost as much e
 ffect on Android’s security as Google. With this in mind\, we decided to ex
 amine Qualcomm’s code in Android devices. During our research\, we found mu
 ltiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduc
 ed by Qualcomm to all its Android devices in multiple different subsystems.
  In this presentation we will review not only the privilege escalation vuln
 erabilities we found\, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploita
 tion\, overcoming all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to
  run kernel-code\, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges an
 d completely bypassing SELinux.\n\nAdam Donenfeld is a lead mobile security
  researcher at Check Point with vast experience in the mobile research fiel
 d. From a young age he has been hacking and reverse engineering for fun and
  profit. Prior to Check Point Adam served in an Israeli elite intelligence 
 unit\, as a security researcher. In his free time\, Adam studies German.
