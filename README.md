# Realtime Bluetooth Device Detection
Couldn't get into the DEFCON 101 room on day 1.  Small room, only one thing going on, several tens of thousands of attendees... thus an endless line.

# Cyber Grand Challenge
Very interesting pre-roll video, lots of quotes from people involved.  Amuzing airgap with a machine that burns a CD with the data for visulization, and a robot that picks it up and drops it over the airgap wall.  :)  Lots of discussion about the visualizations, how the scoring works, how the rounds of the competition works, etc.

# Scoring
Scores are awarded on 3 axes:
   1 availability:  you have to keep your service up, and it has to do what it's supposed to do (eg. serve mail).
   2 security: other teams are attempting to send you "proof of vulnerability" packets; you have to keep those probes from succeeding, presumably by fixing the vulnerability before the other team successfully exploits it against you.
   3 evaluation: when you find a vulnerability, you can send a ping against another team to prove the vulnerability.  You can gain up to 6 "pie pieces" in the visualization, for successfully demonstrating a vulnerability in each service run by each of the other teams.
