# DEFCON 24

DEF CON is a hacking conference in Las Vegas, NV from August 4th-7th.  I'll be attending lots of interesting talks, and dumping notes about them in this repository as I go.  I put together a Google Calendar of [interesting talks](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=joyner.ws_f8gv1f22fi6plfbkgsms4i8470%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles).  The [official complete schedule](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-schedule.html) is also online.  Talks I attend (or at least type notes for) will end up described below.

## The Talks
### Thursday
#### Realtime Bluetooth Device Detection
Couldn't get into the DEFCON 101 room at all on day 1.  Small room, only one thing going on, several tens of thousands of attendees... thus an endless line.
#### [Cyber Grand Challenge](https://github.com/asjoyner/defcon24/blob/master/Cyber Grand Challenge.md)

### Friday
#### [Feds and 0Days](https://github.com/asjoyner/defcon24/blob/master/FedsAnd0Days.md)
