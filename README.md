# DEFCON 24

DEF CON is a hacking conference held in Las Vegas, NV.  This year is DEF CON 24, held from August 4th-7th.  I'll be attending lots of interesting talks, and dumping notes about them in this repository as I go.  I put together a Google Calendar of [interesting talks](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=joyner.ws_f8gv1f22fi6plfbkgsms4i8470%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles), most of which I'll attend.  The [official complete schedule](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-schedule.html) is also online.  Talks I attend (or at least type notes for) will end up described below.

## The Talks
